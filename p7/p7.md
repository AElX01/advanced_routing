# EXECUTIVE REPORT

Certainly! Here's the IPsec configuration introduction, following the same format as the BGP Configuration Guide:

---

This **IPsec Configuration Guide** provides a comprehensive approach to implementing the **IPsec** protocol on Cisco routers, enabling secure communication between remote networks over untrusted channels. IPsec, a suite of protocols designed to secure IP communications, ensures that data transmitted between devices is encrypted, authenticated, and protected from tampering or eavesdropping. In this guide, particular attention is given to the two essential phases of IPsec: **IKE Phase 1** and **IKE Phase 2**, each of which plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining a secure VPN tunnel.

**IKE Phase 1** is the first step in the IPsec process and focuses on establishing a secure, authenticated channel between two peers. The goal is to create a secure and trusted communication link that will later be used for encrypted data transfer. During this phase, administrators configure key parameters, such as the **authentication method**, **encryption algorithms**, and the **Diffie-Hellman group** for key exchange. These settings define the level of security for the tunnel and ensure that the peers can safely exchange sensitive information.

**IKE Phase 2**, following a successful Phase 1 setup, establishes the **IPsec tunnel** for encrypting and securing the actual data being transmitted. This phase negotiates the specific **encryption** and **integrity** algorithms used for securing the traffic, such as **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**, which offers confidentiality and data integrity. By setting up a **transform set**, administrators ensure that the IPsec tunnel adheres to the desired security policies for protecting data during transmission.

To guarantee a reliable and secure connection, this guide also emphasizes the importance of using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to define the traffic that should be encrypted, referred to as "interesting traffic." Administrators can configure ACLs to specify which IP ranges will be part of the secure communication, ensuring that only the intended traffic is protected.

Throughout this guide, configuration examples and real-world scenarios provide practical applications for setting up a Cisco-based IPsec VPN. These configurations allow administrators to secure inter-office communication, connect remote users securely to corporate resources, and protect sensitive data from external threats.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### GOALS

- To configure a private and secure LANs interconnection via the *IPsec* protocol

# IPSEC CONFIGURATION GUIDE REPORT

## IPSEC CONFIGURATION GUIDE

### ASSUMPTIONS

- Internet routers have been configured with the **OSPF** protocol
- *R2* and *R4* only have a default route to their corresponding *Telco*

### IKE PHASE 1 

After the listed assumptions above have been configured on the network diagram, the next step is to interconnect both LANs via an *IPsec* tunnel. The network administrator have to define first the security parameters that *IKE* will use when establishing the secure tunnel (ensure as well the following commands are configured on both peers). THe administrator must define the parameters for both phases (how secure the tunnel will be). The purpose of the *IKE phase 1* is to establish an authenticated and secure channel that *IPsec* data will use.  

- In any of the routers, enter the following command to create an *IKE phase 1* policy, the lower the number is, the higher the priority will be:

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
```

- After creating the *IKE* policy, the network administrator must tell the router it will use a *pre-shared* key for authentication on the phase 1 channel:

```bash 
authentication pre-share
```

- The next step is to set the encryption algorithm phase 1 packets will use, in this case, we defined the encryption algorithm as *aes* with 256-bit lenght:

```bash 
encryption aes 256
```

- To verify data integrity, the network administrator can define an algorithm as follows:

```bash 
hash sha
```

- Next it is required to define the Diffie-Hellman group for key exchange (higher group numbers are more secure but slower):

```bash 
group 2
```

- Define the security assosiation lifetime:

```bash 
lifetime 86400
```

- Lastly, define the pre-shared key that will be used with a certain peer during phase 1 authentication:

```bash 
crypto isakmp key TESTKEY address <PEER IP>
```

### IKE PHASE 2 (IPSEC TUNNEL)


The next step is to establish the IPsec tunnel, which secures data transfer between the two LANs. This phase requires the configuration of the encryption and authentication parameters for securing data packets.

- Define the encryption and authentication methods to protect the data. This step uses Encapsulated Secure Payload (ESP), which provides confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity:

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set <TRANSFORM_SET_NAME> esp-aes 256 esp-sha-hmac
```

- Create a crypto map links the transform set, ACL, and peer IP to establish the IPsec tunnel. The following configuration defines these associations:

```bash
crypto map <NAME-MAP> 10 ipsec-isakmp 
set peer <IP-PEER>
set transform-set <TRANSFORM_SET_NAME> 
match address <ID>
```
The ACL identifies *"interesting traffic"* which specifies the IP ranges that should be encrypted between the two LANs. This ACL matches traffic between the local and remote subnets:

```bash
access-list <ID> permit ip <IP-NETWORK> <WILDCARD> <IP-NETWORK> <WILDCARD>
```

- Once the configuration is done, the network administrator can verify the IPSec tunnel is running with the following commands:

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa
```

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```

Where the first command verifies phase 1 is working and the second one corresponds to phase 2.

### DATA TRAVELING IN A SECURE WAY

# CONCLUSIONS

**Juarez Mota Daniel Alejandro:** This practice helped me to gain a deeper understanding of how the **IPsec protocol** is configured on Cisco routers to establish secure communication between networks. I learned how **IKE Phase 1** and **IKE Phase 2** work together to create a secure IPsec tunnel, with Phase 1 focusing on authenticating the peers and Phase 2 ensuring data confidentiality and integrity during transfer. I also gained insight into how parameters such as encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and Diffie-Hellman groups play a critical role in determining the security of the tunnel.  

Through this exercise, I came to understand the importance of configuring **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to specify "interesting traffic" and the key role they play in controlling which traffic gets encrypted. I also learned how to use Cisco commands like `show crypto isakmp sa` and `show crypto ipsec sa` to verify the status of the IPsec tunnel and troubleshoot potential issues.

**José Enrique Rios Gómez:** This practice was incredibly valuable and enjoyable for me; in fact, I can confidently say it has been my favorite so far. I've always been curious about how VPNs work at a low level, particularly regarding the handling of packets, tunnel encryption, authentication, packet integrity checks, and the time-to-live of the connection before it is renegotiated and re-established through the same processes. 

Additionally, I appreciated the emphasis on security and privacy, especially concerning my network queries. While it's possible to protect oneself at the LAN level, achieving similar security at the WAN level is much more challenging, particularly since ISPs can often monitor traffic.
