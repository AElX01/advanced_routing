# EXECUTIVE REPORT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### GOALS

- To configure a private and secure LANs interconnection via the *IPsec* protocol

# IPSEC CONFIGURATION GUIDE REPORT

## IPSEC CONFIGURATION GUIDE

### ASSUMPTIONS

- Internet routers have been configured with the **OSPF** protocol
- *R2* and *R4* only have a default route to their corresponding *Telco*

### IKE PHASE 1 

After the listed assumptions above have been configured on the network diagram, the next step is to interconnect both LANs via an *IPsec* tunnel. The network administrator have to define first the security parameters that *IKE* will use when establishing the secure tunnel (ensure as well the following commands are configured on both peers). THe administrator must define the parameters for both phases (how secure the tunnel will be). The purpose of the *IKE phase 1* is to establish an authenticated and secure channel that *IPsec* data will use.  

- In any of the routers, enter the following command to create an *IKE phase 1* policy, the lower the number is, the higher the priority will be:

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
```

- After creating the *IKE* policy, the network administrator must tell the router it will use a *pre-shared* key for authentication on the phase 1 channel:

```bash 
authentication pre-share
```

- The next step is to set the encryption algorithm phase 1 packets will use, in this case, we defined the encryption algorithm as *aes* with 256-bit lenght:

```bash 
encryption aes 256
```

- To verify data integrity, the network administrator can define an algorithm as follows:

```bash 
hash sha
```

- Next it is required to define the Diffie-Hellman group for key exchange (higher group numbers are more secure but slower):

```bash 
group 2
```

- Define the security assosiation lifetime:

```bash 
lifetime 86400
```

- Lastly, define the pre-shared key that will be used with a certain peer during phase 1 authentication:

```bash 
crypto isakmp key TESTKEY address <peer ip>
```
